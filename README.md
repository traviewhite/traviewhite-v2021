# Travis White Personal Site v3

![Home](public/v3.png)

### [traviewhite.com](https://www.traviewhite.com/)

The latest version of my personal website. Some may say it's overkill to create a static site with React/Next.js and I might agree. Anyways.. I'm using [contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) to manage all the data and Next.js is handy at updating the page without a rebuild anytime I make an edit from contentful. [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) is used because it's my preferred CSS framework for making quick work of styling changes.

> This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
> Deployed with [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com).
